# TaskForge-Collaborative-Kanban-Board
Created a collaborative Kanban board where users can create cards, assign tasks, define dependencies, and see visual links between cards..................I I provided the code file



TaskForge is a web-based project management tool designed to enhance team collaboration and streamline workflows using a visual Kanban board. It allows teams to:

Visualize their work: Through customizable columns (like To Do, In Progress, Done), teams get a clear overview of task progress.
Collaboratively manage tasks: All authorized users on a board can create, edit, and delete task cards, as well as assign them to specific team members and set due dates.
Define and visualize task dependencies: Users can explicitly link cards to indicate dependencies, establishing "blocking" relationships between tasks. TaskForge visually represents these dependencies using graph or arrow overlays directly on the Kanban board.
Understand blockers at a glance: The visual representation of dependencies makes it easy to identify which tasks are blocked and by what. Clicking on a dependency link provides further details.
Manage workflow with drag and drop: Cards can be easily moved between columns to reflect their current status. The system also enforces dependency rules, preventing users from moving a card to the "Done" column if its dependent tasks are not yet complete.
Stay informed with real-time updates: An activity feed provides a live stream of actions taken on the board, such as card movements and new issues. In-app notifications keep users informed about assignments and blocked moves.
Control access and permissions: The board creator has control over who can join the board and what level of permissions they have. Guests can be invited for viewing purposes only.
Ensure secure access: The platform requires user login to access boards and their functionalities.
